# Astro 331: space systems engineering



# 01: intro 



## admin

### course policies

### syllabus

FlatSAT labs

- electrical system
- camera
- communication
- attitude
- integration

mini labs

- logic/breadboarding
- electricity
- metrology
- thermal
- vibration demo

### lecture note look and feel

We’ll use several new tools in this class, including

- git/github/tortoisegit
  - https://github.com/usafa-astro-331/astro-331-2023-fall
- markdown/marktext
- latex/overleaf
- arduino/arduino-cli
- batch scripts
- teraterm serial terminal



Some things (like the textbook) will remain on Teams. 



Lessons will usually look like this instead of powerpoint slides

like Wheel of Fortune before & after category

This course will cover and combine 2 subjects:

- space systems
- systems engineering

### Systems Engineering

What is systems engineering? 



#### Systems Engineering

| Source           | definition                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| NASA SE handbook | a methodical, multi-disciplinary approach for the design, realization, technical management, operations, and retirement of a system |
| INCOSE           | transdisciplinary and integrative approach to enable the successful realization, use, and retirement of engineered systems, using systems principles and concepts, and scientific, technological, and management methods.<br /><br />We use the terms “engineering” and “engineered” in their widest sense: “the action of working artfully to bring something about”. |
| wikipedia        | interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to **design, integrate, and manage complex systems over their life cycles.** |



#### System

| Source           | definition                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| NASA SE handbook | the combination of elements that function together to produce the capability required to meet a need |
| INCOSE           | “Engineered systems” may be composed of any or all of people, products, services, information, processes, and natural elements. |
| wikipedia        | a combination of components that work in synergy to collectively perform a useful function. |



But what *is* it?

INCOSE:

> Systems Engineering provides facilitation, guidance and leadership to integrate the relevant disciplines and specialty groups into a cohesive effort, forming an appropriately structured development process that  proceeds from concept to production, operation, evolution and eventual  disposal.
>
> Systems Engineering **considers both the business and the technical  needs** of customers with the **goal of providing a quality solution that  meets the needs of users and other stakeholders**, is fit for the intended purpose in real-world operation, and avoids or minimizes adverse  unintended consequences. 
>
> The **goal of all Systems Engineering activities is to manage risk**,  including the risk of not delivering what the customer wants and needs,  the risk of late delivery, the risk of excess cost, and the risk of  negative unintended consequences. One measure of utility of Systems  Engineering activities is the degree to which such risk is reduced.  Conversely, a measure of acceptability of absence of a System  Engineering activity is the level of excess risk incurred as a result.



INCOSE again: 

> Systems Engineering (SE) focuses on ten key activities:
>
> 1. establishing **stakeholders’ success criteria** and concerns, and  defining actual or anticipated customer needs and required  functionality, early in the development cycle, and revising them as new  information is gained and lessons are learned;
> 2. investigating the **solution space**, proposing alternative solution and operational concepts, weighing their value (viability, utility,  benefit at cost) and selecting the optimal or most appropriate  concept(s);
> 3. **architecting a solution** or set of solutions based on the  selected concept(s) while considering potential concepts of employment  and usage;
> 4. **modelling** (or otherwise evaluating) the solution at each relevant phase of the endeavour, considering both normal and exceptional scenarios, and an appropriate diversity of viewpoints, in order to:
>        a. establish required capability and performance; 
>        b. increase confidence that the solution will work as expected and  required, while avoiding or minimizing undesirable unintended  consequences; 
>        c. ensure the solution is resilient and can evolve if required to  adapt to anticipated or possible changes in the user needs and  operational environments; 
>        d. provide ongoing prediction and assessment of system effectiveness and value;
> 5. defining and managing the **interfaces**, both within the system and between the system and the rest of the world (noting that increasingly, systems engineering is conducted in a brown-field rather than a  green-field environment, so legacy systems may be a major or key part of the overall solution);
> 6. establishing appropriate process and lifecycle models that  consider complexity, uncertainty, change and variety, and implementing  system management and governance processes for both development and  through-life use and disposal;
> 7. proceeding with detailed design synthesis, integration, and  solution ve**rification and validation** (ensuring the solution is fit for  the intended purpose) while considering the complete problem (including  aspects of dependability such as safety, security, reliability,  availability, logistic support, and disaster recovery), all necessary  enabling systems and services, and end-of-life processes (e.g.  transition to a replacement system, recycling of the retired one,  nuclear decommissioning and waste disposal…);
> 8. providing the SE knowledge and information required by all  stakeholder groups to ensure coherence of the whole endeavour –  typically including a vision statement, operational concepts, business  drivers, analyses and recommendations for decision support and the  business case, architecture definition, organizational policies and  processes, required properties and interfaces of the system and its  elements (including common standards to ensure interoperability),  verification and validation criteria, analysis and interpretation of  test and evaluation results, anticipated operational usage, and  appropriate system configurations for different scenarios;
> 9. supporting **transition to use**, considering all aspects including people, processes, information and technology;
> 10. **periodically re-evaluating** status, risks and opportunities,  stakeholder feedback, observed or anticipated unintended consequences,  and anticipated system effectiveness and value, and recommending any  appropriate corrective, mitigation or recovery actions to ensure  continuing system success. Such activities during the operational phase  can include upgrade activities, obsolescence management, maintenance and repair activities, manufacturing changes, changing operational  processes, user training, instituting metrics and incentives, assessing  information quality and integrity, and making other changes to the  system.
